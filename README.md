# Weather App
Developed by [Nathan](https://github.com/NathanBrodin)
Weather app developed with Flutter in Dart. The app is using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the weather data.
It's a simple app that shows the weather for the current location and the next 5 days.

## Illustrations
Illustrations are generated with [MidJourney](https://midjourney.app/) using the prompt "a digital vector illustration of a landscape representing mountains, a forest and a river on a bright sunny day, minimalist --q .25 --ar 4:7".

## Icons
Icons are from [this dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/15349865-Cloudy-Icons-Light) by [ihmdone](https://dribbble.com/ihmdone).
